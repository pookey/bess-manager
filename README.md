# BESS Battery Manager Add-on for Home Assistant

Intelligent Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) management and optimization for Home Assistant.

> **💰 Maximize your battery savings** by automatically optimizing your battery storage system with real-time price data, solar integration, and adaptive scheduling.

## Overview

The BESS Battery Manager is a sophisticated Home Assistant add-on that automatically optimizes Growatt inverter battery storage systems using dynamic programming algorithms and electricity market pricing. It continuously analyzes published electricity prices, solar production forecasts, and consumption predictions to determine optimal charge/discharge schedules that minimize your electricity costs.

The system requires the Growatt, a price source (Nordpool or Octopus Energy), and solar forecast (e.g., Solcast) Home Assistant integrations to function, and optionally uses InfluxDB for historical data storage. Unlike simple timer-based systems, BESS Manager makes intelligent decisions by weighing multiple factors: current battery state, published electricity prices, solar weather forecasts, consumption estimates, and battery degradation costs. The system updates its optimization strategy every hour as new sensor data becomes available, ensuring your battery always operates in the most economically beneficial way while respecting technical constraints like charge rates and depth-of-discharge limits.

## Key Capabilities

**Dynamic Programming Optimization**: Solves 24-hour battery scheduling as an optimization problem, considering electricity prices, solar forecasts, consumption patterns, and battery constraints to find the globally optimal charge/discharge schedule.

**Electricity Market Integration**: Supports Nordpool (Nordic markets, 15-min resolution) and Octopus Energy Agile tariff (UK market, 30-min resolution with separate import/export rates).

**Battery Wear Economics**: Incorporates battery degradation costs (cycle cost) into optimization calculations to balance immediate savings against long-term battery life.

**Hourly Re-optimization**: Recalculates the optimal 24-hour schedule every hour as predicted values become actual.

**Consumption Forecasting**: Four configurable strategies for predicting home consumption — from a simple fixed value to InfluxDB weekly profiles and ML-based weather-aware predictions. Set `consumption_strategy` in config to choose.

**Comprehensive Energy Tracking**: Tracks all energy flows (solar production, grid import/export, battery charge/discharge, home consumption) with detailed cost analysis and savings calculations.

**Power Monitoring & Fuse Protection**: Monitors grid current to prevent overloading electrical fuses by limiting battery charging when household consumption is high.

### Web Interface

The BESS Manager provides a comprehensive web interface organized into focused pages:

**Dashboard**: Real-time system overview with live energy flows, current battery optimization decisions, and today's performance summary.

**Savings**: Financial analysis with daily savings breakdown, cost comparisons between grid-only vs solar-only vs optimized battery scenarios, and detailed hourly cost analysis.

**Inverter**: Detailed information about your inverter including current status, active schedule, operating modes, and configuration settings.

**Insights**: Understand the economic reasoning behind every battery decision - why the system chose to charge, discharge, or remain idle at any given time.

**System Health**: Component status monitoring with sensor validation, integration health checks, and system diagnostics.

## Claude Code Integration

BESS Manager includes an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for integration with Claude Code, enabling AI-assisted debugging and log analysis.

To enable, add to `.claude/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bess": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["scripts/bess-mcp-server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

Configure connection in `.env`:

```bash
HA_URL=https://your-homeassistant-url
HA_TOKEN=your-long-lived-access-token
```
