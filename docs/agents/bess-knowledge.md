# BESS Domain Knowledge

This document contains the domain knowledge an analyst needs to answer
questions about the BESS Manager battery optimization system.  It is the
single source of truth for both the in-app AI chat and the GitHub analysis
agent.

For deeper investigation, use tools to read the source code directly.
Key files: `core/bess/dp_battery_algorithm.py` (optimizer),
`core/bess/models.py` (data models), `core/bess/energy_flow_calculator.py`
(flow decomposition), `core/bess/growatt_schedule.py` (schedule generation),
`core/bess/battery_system_manager.py` (orchestrator).


## How the System Works

BESS Manager optimizes a home battery to minimize electricity costs.  Every
15 minutes it re-runs a dynamic programming optimizer that looks at:

- **Electricity prices** (today + tomorrow when available, at 15-min resolution)
- **Solar production forecast**
- **Consumption prediction** (time-of-day shaped or flat, depending on strategy)
- **Current battery state** (charge level, cost basis of stored energy)
- **Battery parameters** (capacity, efficiency, cycle cost)

The optimizer produces a schedule of battery actions (charge / discharge /
idle) for each 15-minute slot from now through the end of available price
data.  This schedule is applied to the inverter via Home Assistant.

**Re-optimization**: The system re-runs every 15 minutes.  Each run uses the
latest actual data (replacing predictions with measurements) and may produce
a different schedule.  Common triggers for schedule changes:
- Tomorrow's prices become available (typically around 13:00 for Nordpool)
- Actual solar or consumption differs from the forecast
- Battery state differs from what was predicted


## The Dynamic Programming Algorithm

The optimizer uses **backward induction**.  Starting from the last period and
working backwards, it evaluates all possible battery actions at each period
and selects the one that minimizes total electricity cost over the remaining
horizon.

**State space**: Discretized battery state of energy (SOE) levels.

**Actions**: Charge, discharge, or idle at various power levels — filtered
by physical constraints (available energy, remaining capacity, power limits).

**Transition**: Each action updates SOE accounting for charge/discharge
efficiency losses and updates the **cost basis** of stored energy.

**Objective**: Minimize net electricity cost (grid import cost minus export
revenue) while accounting for battery cycle degradation costs and a terminal
value for energy remaining at end of horizon.

**Terminal value**: Applies unconditionally at whatever the current horizon
boundary is — midnight-today when only today's prices are available,
midnight-tomorrow once tomorrow's prices have landed and the horizon
extends. Without it, the DP has no visibility past the horizon and would
have no reason not to drain the battery completely in the last period; this
holds regardless of where that boundary currently sits, since no provider
ever supplies data past midnight-tomorrow either. Each leftover kWh at the
horizon's end is valued at:

    terminal_value = median(buy_prices) * efficiency_discharge - cycle_cost

where `buy_prices`/`sell_prices` are already truncated to whatever the
current horizon is, capped at `max(sell_prices) * efficiency_discharge -
cycle_cost` — an **arbitrage-consistency cap** that prevents the estimate
from exceeding what could actually be realized by selling right now at the
best available price (`core/bess/battery_system_manager.py:1840-1908`,
`_calculate_terminal_value`; see issues #126/#244/#246/#345). This is the
mechanism to check first for "why didn't the battery discharge everything
right before midnight" or "why does it hold charge near the end of the
horizon" — it applies at both the today-only and today+tomorrow boundary,
so this remains the first thing to check even after tomorrow's prices have
arrived (until #345, it was incorrectly zeroed in that case; see the #345/
#126 threads for the "tonight's export moves a day later" symptom this was
suspected of, and ultimately ruled out for a specific bundle).

**Self-throttling near self-consumption (issue #240)**: In `_compute_reward`,
a discharge whose overshoot above `home_consumption` is
`<= BATTERY_EXPORT_THRESHOLD_KWH` (0.01 kWh,
`core/bess/dp_battery_algorithm.py:96`) has its `grid_exported` forced to
zero for reward purposes — the DP treats it as pure self-consumption, not an
export sale, because load-first hardware doesn't reliably deliver a trivial
overshoot to the grid in practice. When evaluating whether a small discharge
was "worth" `sell_price`, check this threshold first: below it, the relevant
alternative-value comparison is against the buy price avoided, not the sell
price (`core/bess/dp_battery_algorithm.py:511-522`).

**Cost basis tracking (weighted average)**: When the battery charges at
different prices over time, the system tracks the cost of stored energy as a
**weighted average**, not FIFO. On charge: `new_cost_basis = (soe *
cost_basis + new_energy_cost) / next_soe`
(`core/bess/dp_battery_algorithm.py:496-498`). On discharge, `cost_basis` is
left unchanged — there is no "oldest energy first" queue or layered
accounting anywhere in the code.

**All-IDLE safety net (not a profit threshold)**: After optimization, an
all-IDLE schedule is unconditionally computed and swapped in only if its
`battery_solar_cost` is cheaper than the optimized schedule's
(`core/bess/dp_battery_algorithm.py:1514-1536`). This is a plain cost
comparison — there is **no minimum-profit threshold and no day-fraction
scaling**. An earlier design had a threshold/guardrail here; it was removed
in the "Bellman-optimality guardrail removal" refactor (commit
`ee24537f`/`f57d4fed`,
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-06-dp-bellman-guardrail-removal-design.md`)
because the DP's backward induction already finds the Bellman-optimal
schedule, making an extra economic gate redundant. What remains is a
numerical safety net for SOE-discretization residual, not an economic
judgment call. The fallback still passively absorbs any solar surplus into
available battery room and pays wear cost on it, but never discharges to
recoup that cost, so it isn't automatically better than what it would
replace.

**Shadow price (marginal value of stored energy)**: The backward induction
builds a value-to-go for every (period, SOE-level) state — the best achievable
result from that point onward.  The **shadow price** of a period is the slope
of that value across SOE: *how much one extra kWh of stored energy is worth,
in SEK, given the optimal future use of it*.  It is **not** the cost basis
(what the energy cost to store — a sunk cost).  It is the forward-looking
**opportunity value**, and it automatically accounts for everything the
optimizer can do with that kWh later: avoid a future expensive grid purchase,
export it at a future high sell price, or — crucially — nothing extra, because
upcoming solar will refill the battery anyway (**replenishment**).  Each
period's shadow price is stored on its decision data and is used at apply time
for the SOLAR_EXPORT discharge gate (below).


## The Governing Economic Law (read this first)

Every battery action is judged by its **marginal net value against the next-best
alternative for that same slot** — never by its gross value, and never against
"do nothing = 0".

The opportunity cost of a stored kWh is its **forward-looking `shadow_price`** (the
DP's value-to-go slope), floored by `sell_price` when upcoming solar will replenish
the battery for free. It is **not** the sunk `cost_basis`, and **not** zero.

Operational forms of the one law:

- **Discharge to grid** is worthwhile only if
  `sell_price × efficiency_discharge > opportunity_cost_of_stored_kWh`.
- **Discharge to cover home load** is worthwhile only if it beats the cheapest
  alternative for that kWh (usually a future avoided import at a higher buy price).
- **Charge** is worthwhile only if the stored kWh's future value exceeds what it
  cost to store it (grid/solar cost + wear).

The classic error this prevents: treating `sell_price > wear_cost` as "profitable".
That compares gross sale value to wear and ignores the counterfactual. If the real
alternative is "let solar keep charging one more slot and export one slot earlier",
the value captured is only the **differential** in sell price between the two slots,
which must still clear the wear cost. A 6 öre differential against a 40 öre wear
cost is a loss, not a 6 öre gain.

**Reconciliation with the code:** `_compute_reward`
(`core/bess/dp_battery_algorithm.py:409-541`) no longer implements an explicit
profitability floor. That anti-cycling floor was removed in the
"Bellman-optimality guardrail removal" refactor (commit
`ee24537f`/`f57d4fed`,
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-06-dp-bellman-guardrail-removal-design.md`);
the function's current docstring states "No profitability veto: every
physically valid discharge gets a finite reward... a separate floor on top
of that is redundant at best." The governing economic law above still holds
as the *outcome* of backward induction (the DP won't choose a discharge that
isn't marginally worthwhile), but it is enforced by the value-to-go
comparison across the whole horizon, not by a floor inside `_compute_reward`.

### Facts vs Economics — where each lives in a debug bundle

Answer "what happened" and "why" from different parts of the bundle, in that order:

- **Facts (what happened):** `## Optimization Schedules → ### Period Decisions`
  table. Columns: `Intent | Observed | BattAct | SOE start→end | BuyPrice |
  Savings`. A negative `BattAct` with a falling `SOE` is a battery discharge — read
  this before proposing any mechanism. Solar-only export shows `BattAct ≈ 0`.
- **Economics (why):** the Full Schedule JSON `<details>` block — `sell_price`,
  `buy_price`, `cost_basis`, `shadow_price` per period — plus `### Economic Summary`.
- **Period ↔ clock time:** slots are 15 minutes. Map the question's clock time to a
  period number and confirm it. Watch the off-by-one: the price shown for 15:45 is
  the 15:45 slot's price, not 16:00's.

### Illustrative: applying the law (method demo, not a lookup)

*Illustrative only — the method generalizes to any period. Do not pattern-match the
scenario; reproduce the reasoning steps.*

A battery discharges a small amount to grid in a slot where `sell = 0.46`,
`wear = 0.40`.

- **Wrong (gross):** `0.46 > 0.40 → +6 öre, profitable.`
- **Right (marginal):** the alternative is to let solar charge one more slot and
  export one slot earlier, so only the sell-price *differential* (~0.06) is gained,
  against 0.40 wear ⇒ ≈ `−0.34 SEK/kWh`, a loss. Equivalently: `shadow_price` (e.g.
  0.876) and `cost_basis` (e.g. 0.62) both exceed `sell 0.46`, so the stored kWh is
  worth more kept than exported ⇒ do not discharge.
- If different optimization runs disagree on such a near-threshold slot, the cause
  is `shadow_price` sensitivity across re-optimizations, not a missing mechanism.


## Strategic Intents

Every 15-minute slot gets a strategic intent based on the energy flows the
optimizer chose: **GRID_CHARGING**, **SOLAR_STORAGE**, **LOAD_SUPPORT**,
**BATTERY_EXPORT**, **SOLAR_EXPORT**, **IDLE**. The exact classification
thresholds live in `core/bess/decision_intelligence.py` — read that file
directly rather than relying on a copy of the numbers here, since they are
implementation detail that can change independently of this doc.

**Hardware mapping**: Intents control actual inverter behavior:
- GRID_CHARGING → battery_first mode + grid charge ON
- LOAD_SUPPORT → load_first mode
- BATTERY_EXPORT → grid_first mode (battery discharge to grid)
- SOLAR_STORAGE / SOLAR_EXPORT / IDLE → load_first mode (solar serves home first)

### BATTERY_EXPORT vs SOLAR_EXPORT (why the split exists)

Both export to grid, but they are different situations and need different
inverter modes:
- **BATTERY_EXPORT**: the battery is *actively discharging to grid* for profit
  → `grid_first` + an action-derived discharge rate.
- **SOLAR_EXPORT**: the battery is *idle and full*; only the **solar surplus**
  flows to grid → `load_first`.  The battery is not pushed to grid.

Earlier both were one intent (`EXPORT_ARBITRAGE`) mapped to `grid_first`, which
wrongly locked the inverter in grid-export mode for hours during sunny
daytimes while the battery sat unable to help the house.

### The SOLAR_EXPORT discharge gate (load_first + discharge rate 0 or 100)

`discharge_rate` is a **hardware register** written every period, not just a
schedule label.  At `discharge_rate=0` the battery is forbidden to discharge at
all — so it cannot cover the house load if solar dips *within* a period.  At
`discharge_rate=100` `load_first` lets the battery cover an intra-period deficit
(it still won't export — that's grid_first).

Whether a SOLAR_EXPORT period should allow that cover is an **economic** choice,
decided per period from the **shadow price** (above):

> Cover the dip from the battery only when the stored energy is worth *less*
> than buying that energy from the grid right now:
> **`buy_price × discharge_efficiency ≥ shadow_price` → rate 100, else rate 0`.**
> (The efficiency factor applies only to the buy side — the shadow price is
> already per-kWh-of-stored-energy.)

What this works out to in practice — important for analysis:
- During SOLAR_EXPORT the battery is full and exporting surplus, so its marginal
  kWh is only worth the **export (sell) price** — the surplus refills it for
  free (replenishment).  The shadow price therefore ≈ the sell price.
- **Normal prices** (`buy > sell`): the gate is **100** — covering the dip from
  the battery beats buying from grid, because solar refills the battery.  This
  is the usual case.
- **Inverted prices** (export premium or negative buy, i.e. `sell ≥ buy×eff`):
  the gate is **0** — the energy is worth more exported than the cheap grid
  import it would replace, so export it and buy the dip from grid.

So a SOLAR_EXPORT period showing `discharge_rate=0` is **not a bug** — it means
prices were inverted that period.  And `discharge_rate=100` on SOLAR_EXPORT does
**not** mean the battery is being drained: `load_first` only discharges to an
actual house deficit, and at 15-minute resolution a SOLAR_EXPORT period is net
surplus (deficit 0), so planned vs realized economics are unchanged.  The gate
only affects *sub-15-minute* hardware behaviour.

### The inverter AC output cap (solar clipping avoidance)

`inverter_max_ac_power_kw` (BatterySettings, default 0 = disabled) models a
hybrid inverter whose **total AC output** (PV DC→AC conversion plus battery
discharge) is capped — e.g. 5 kW on a Growatt MIN 5000TL-XH — while DC-coupled
PV *above* the cap can still charge the battery directly, but only while the
battery has room.  With the cap set:

- **Clipped solar is worth zero** in the DP: per period, solar not stored
  DC-side is deliverable to home/grid only up to
  `cap × (1 − inverter_ac_power_margin) × dt`; the excess is `clipped_solar`
  (reported per period on `EnergyData` and as `clippedSolar` in the API).
  A full battery during above-cap solar is therefore genuinely costly, which
  is what pushes the optimizer to reserve headroom for the midday peak.
- **Deferring absorption uses the SOLAR_EXPORT-below-max bypass (#313)**:
  normally IDLE passively absorbs surplus, so a reward change alone cannot
  defer charging.  The existing bypass candidate (SoE held exactly unchanged,
  surplus exports up to the cap, the rest clips) is what expresses "export
  the surplus, keep the room" — with the cap set, its reward is cap-aware, so
  the DP chooses it ahead of the above-cap window.  These periods classify as
  **SOLAR_EXPORT** with `battery_action = 0` and a not-full battery, meaning
  "deliberately holding for later overflow".
- **Hardware mapping**: SOLAR_EXPORT writes `charge_rate=0` (#313, all
  configurations), stopping `load_first` from passively filling the battery.
  On a genuinely full battery this is a no-op.  The shadow-price *discharge*
  gate above is unchanged and orthogonal.
- **Discharge shares the cap**: battery discharge is limited to the AC
  headroom the (possibly clipped) solar leaves
  (`cap − min(solar, cap)` per period), both in the DP's feasible actions and
  in the simulator.
- The **margin** (default 0.05) is a model-side haircut on the cap
  compensating for hourly Solcast forecasts flattening sub-period peaks; it is
  never written to hardware.
- Requires per-period charge-rate control (Growatt MIN).  On platforms
  without it (SPH, SolaX native) the plan is cap-aware but deferred
  absorption is not hardware-enforceable.


## Execution Layer: What Can Override the Schedule

The DP schedule is not the last word — several mechanisms outside the
optimizer can change what the hardware actually does. Check these *before*
concluding a mechanism is "missing" from the DP when observed behavior
doesn't match the schedule:

- **Discharge inhibit sensor**: an external `binary_sensor` (auto-detected by
  entity ID suffix `_charging`/`_is_charging`, e.g. EV charging status) can
  force `discharge_rate` to 0 regardless of what the schedule says, checked
  independently of the 15-min optimization cycle
  (`core/bess/battery_system_manager.py:3089-3113`, polled every minute) and
  applied at schedule-write time
  (`core/bess/battery_system_manager.py:2578-2582`). If a period's
  `Observed` behavior shows no discharge despite `Intent: BATTERY_EXPORT` or
  `LOAD_SUPPORT`, check for an active discharge-inhibit sensor before
  suspecting the DP or the intent-to-hardware mapping.
- **Temperature derating**: charge power can be capped below the configured
  max on cold days via a weather-forecast-driven derating curve
  (`core/bess/battery_system_manager.py:1917-1966`,
  `_get_temperature_derated_charge_limits`). If the weather entity isn't
  configured, this **silently returns no derating** rather than failing —
  so its absence in one installation vs. presence in another is expected,
  not a bug.
- **`charging_power_rate` setting is cosmetic after startup (known
  limitation, not a documented mechanism)**: this settings-page value only
  seeds the initial charge-power target once, before the first control
  cycle. Every cycle after that, the actual hardware charge rate comes from
  `INTENT_TO_CONTROL`, which only ever emits 0% or 100% — it never reads
  this setting again (`core/bess/battery_system_manager.py:2037-2064`,
  `adjust_charging_power`). If a user reports "changing the charge power
  rate slider did nothing," this is why — it is a known bug, tracked in
  `TODO.md`, not a settings-propagation issue to re-diagnose from scratch.

## Price Calculation

The optimizer works with buy and sell prices derived from spot prices:

    buy_price  = (spot + markup) * VAT_multiplier + additional_costs
    sell_price = spot + export_compensation

For Octopus Energy (UK), prices are already final — no markup/VAT applied.

For when a discharge is worthwhile, see **The Governing Economic Law** above —
gross `sell_price` vs `cycle_cost` is *not* the test; marginal value vs the
counterfactual is.


## Energy Flow Decomposition

The system decomposes measured energy totals into detailed flows using
energy conservation, but flows are **clamped to measured grid totals**
(`grid_imported`/`grid_exported`) rather than derived by pure subtraction —
pure subtraction can invent flows out of cross-sensor noise (fixed in PR
#342). See `core/bess/models.py` (`EnergyData._calculate_detailed_flows`,
~lines 90-146) and `core/bess/energy_flow_calculator.py` (~lines 176-183) for
the current formulas, e.g.:

    solar_to_battery = max(0, solar_production - export_to_grid
                             - self_consumption + battery_discharged)
    solar_to_battery = min(solar_to_battery, battery_charged, solar_production)

Home consumption gets solar first (free), then grid.  Battery charges from
solar first (free), then grid (paid) — but the exact split is reconciled
against measured grid import/export, not assumed from production figures
alone.

A second, related noise source lives one level up: even after #342's
zero-aggregate cap, a `battery_to_grid` residual can still survive when its
governing aggregate (`battery_discharged`) is itself nonzero — the residual
is then indistinguishable from ordinary lifetime-counter quantization
(documented 0.1 kWh resolution, `sensor_collector.py:231`) rather than a real
export, and it corrupts `infer_intent_from_flows`'s `observed_intent`
(`BATTERY_EXPORT` requires an inverter mode change; a residual this small
proves nothing about mode). Fixed in #350: `_calculate_detailed_flows` folds
any `battery_to_grid` below the 0.1 kWh floor back into `battery_to_home`,
but *only* when `battery_to_home > 0` — i.e. only when the battery was
already covering a genuine home deficit and the residual plausibly reflects
under-reading on that same deficit. When `battery_to_home == 0` (home's need
already fully met by solar), any nonzero export — however small — has no
other channel to have come from and is left as a real export (see the R==P
Bellman-guardrail regression test in `test_dp_no_guardrails.py`, which
requires exactly this for a genuine 0.05 kWh 100%-export discharge). Note the
DP's own planning-time classifier, `classify_strategic_intent` in
`decision_intelligence.py`, already used `battery_to_grid > 0.1 kWh` as its
threshold — #350 brings the observational path's noise handling in line with
that existing precedent, though the two classifiers remain otherwise
distinct (planning vs. after-the-fact labeling).


## Prediction Snapshots and Expected Savings

Every time the optimizer runs, a **prediction snapshot** is saved recording:

    expected_savings = actual_savings + predicted_savings

- **Actual savings**: Sum of savings for completed time slots (past).
- **Predicted savings**: Sum of savings for future time slots (from the
  latest optimization schedule).

**Expected savings should NOT naturally decrease as time passes.**  As the
day progresses, predictions become actuals, but the total should stay
roughly the same IF the system performs as predicted.

If expected savings DROP between snapshots, it means something changed:

1. **Tomorrow's prices became available** — the optimizer now sees a longer
   horizon and may shift profitable discharge from today to tomorrow.
   Check: did the schedule's horizon expand?  Do tomorrow's prices exist?

2. **Actual solar was lower than forecast** — less free energy means more
   grid purchases.  Check: compare Historical Data solar column vs what
   the schedule predicted for the same time slots.

3. **Actual consumption was higher than estimated** — more demand than
   expected (e.g., EV charging).  Check: compare Historical Data import
   column vs schedule predictions.

4. **Prices changed between runs** — updated price data shifted the
   economics.  Check: logs for price fetch events.

**NEVER say savings "naturally decay" or "diminish over time."** A drop
is always caused by a specific, identifiable change.


## Consumption Prediction Strategies

The optimizer needs a consumption forecast.  Four strategies exist:

- **ha_statistics** (recommended): Builds a 96-period time-of-day profile
  from the past 7 days of HA Recorder data, bucketed by hour-of-day.  For
  each hour it drops only the single highest (and lowest, if ≥5 samples)
  of the 7 daily values before averaging.  This discounts a one-off
  irregular spike (e.g. an unusual EV charging session on one day) but
  does **not** strip out a regular/nightly EV charging habit — if most of
  the 7 samples for an hour are elevated together, the average stays high
  and the forecast correctly bakes that load in.  Higher during evening
  peaks, lower overnight.
- **influxdb_7d_avg**: Same concept but queries InfluxDB instead of HA.
- **sensor**: Reads a 48-hour rolling average sensor.  Produces a flat
  prediction (same value all day).
- **fixed**: A single fixed kWh/hour value.  Does not adapt.


## Savings Calculation

There are two savings metrics.  The distinction matters when reporting numbers:

**Total savings** (shown on the dashboard Savings card):

    total_savings = grid_only_cost - hourly_cost

This is the full benefit of having solar + battery compared to grid-only.

**Battery-only savings** (per-period `hourly_savings` in data tables):

    hourly_savings = solar_only_cost - hourly_cost

This isolates the battery's contribution on top of what solar already saves.

Total savings = solar savings + battery savings.  Summing per-period
`hourly_savings` gives a lower number than the dashboard total because it
excludes the solar benefit.

Positive savings = the system saved money.  Negative savings = the battery
action cost more than doing nothing (can happen during charging periods —
the benefit comes later when discharging).

Cost baselines:
- **grid_only_cost**: Cost if no solar or battery existed (all consumption from grid)
- **solar_only_cost**: Cost with solar but no battery optimization
- **hourly_cost** (aka optimized cost): Actual cost with full optimization


## Evidence-Based Analysis

When analyzing system behavior:

- Every claim must be backed by specific data — a row in the data tables,
  a log line, or a line of source code.
- NEVER speculate.  Do not use "likely", "probably", "suggests", "may have".
  State what happened with evidence, or say you don't have enough data.
- Start from what the data shows, not from a theory.
- Use tools (read_file, search_code) to verify claims against actual code.
