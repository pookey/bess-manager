    Historical reconstruction is an optional enhancement (it backfills actuals

class PWLWindowUnderRefinedError(RuntimeError):
    """The windowed PWL solve hit one of its own accuracy budgets, so the
    value table it would return is an approximation of unknown quality.

    Distinct from the *infeasible* case (`pwl_window_is_feasible`), which is
    an ordinary physical outcome the solver reports honestly. This one means
    the solver cannot certify its own answer at all: the only reason the
    hybrid path (#450) re-solves a window is that the grid DP's result on it
    is not trustworthy to within tie-margin accuracy, so handing back a
    result of *unknown* accuracy and letting it be spliced in as if exact
    would replace one silent inaccuracy with another -- precisely the
    fallback `docs/agents/rules.md` forbids. Raising instead makes the
    condition impossible to miss.

    It DOES fire in practice, and the budgets are not the knob. #624 hit it
    in the field on a nine-period merged tie window: the preimage cross
    product compounds per backward step, so the reachable horizon is ~8
    periods and no budget raise extends it (`measure_tie_coverage.py`).
    `dp_battery_algorithm`'s Step 2b therefore catches this exception --
    alone among the raises here -- and bisects the window, re-solving each
    half under this same certification. Reaching a caller means either a
    horizon-1 window that still cannot certify (not a sizing problem) or a
    solve outside that path.

class PWLEndSoeOutOfRangeError(ValueError):
    """The pinned `end_soe_target` lies outside `[min_soe_kwh, max_soe_kwh]`,
    so no terminal row can be built for it.

    A `ValueError` subclass so existing callers and tests that catch
    `ValueError` are unaffected; the distinct type exists so a caller that
    legitimately expects this specific condition (the #450 coverage suite hits
    it on below-min-SOE recovery trajectories) can select for it by type
    instead of matching a substring of this module's prose error message.

    hour the plan silently ignored.

    unreadable, since the forecast would silently overstate consumption by
    the missing residual.
