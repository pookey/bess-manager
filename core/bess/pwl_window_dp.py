    matters because the block builds a dense `|X| x |actions|` matrix and a
    dozen same-shape temporaries, `|actions|` is ~102 for every battery
    (`discharge_rate_step_kw` is `max_discharge_power_kw / 100`, so the count
    is fixed by the lattice, not the hardware), and `|X|` compounds per
    backward stage via the discharge-preimage cross product. Measured cost is
    a flat ~10 kB per breakpoint, so the tens of thousands of breakpoints a
    five-period window reaches turned into ~1.1 GB RSS and an OOM kill --
    a kill, not an exception, so none of the accuracy budgets ever got to
    speak and #624's bisection was structurally unreachable.

    Blocking is exact, not an approximation: every reduction in the block is
    over `axis=1` (actions), including the import-cap floor, so rows are
    independent and `concatenate(block(X_i)) == block(X)` bitwise. It also

    Returns `window_horizon + 1` PWL rows `(xs, vs)`; `V[window_horizon]` is
    the pinned terminal row. Task 6's resolver forward-replays this table
    from the window's known start SOE, so the window reconnects to the
    untouched grid-DP schedule on both sides.

    Each row is built by evaluating the Bellman objective on a seeded
    breakpoint set, adaptively probing every interval for hidden kinks
    (bisection plus a golden-section probe, so a kink at the midpoint can't
    hide), and finally pruning collinear points. `_pwl_prune`'s tolerance
    stays at the economics-scale `PWL_EPS_PRUNE`: against the pin's ~1e6
    SEK/kWh gradient it is effectively a no-op near the target, which is
    precisely the behaviour needed -- the penalty spike is preserved, only
    genuinely flat economic regions get collapsed.

    `end_soe_tolerance` is floored at half the discharge action lattice --
    see `_end_soe_pin_tolerance`.

    `import_cap_kwh` is the caller's fuse-derived per-period grid-import cap
    (#429), one entry per window period (aligned with `buy_price` etc. --
    the caller slices the horizon-level cap to the window exactly as it
    slices every other per-period input), and must carry the same values the
    surrounding grid DP solved with: the window is re-solved precisely where
    charging-vs-not is closest, so omitting it here would let the exact
    solver propose grid charging the house's fuse cannot carry, in exactly
    the periods where the constraint is most likely to bind. Passing `None`
    means "no cap for any period in the window", which is correct only when
    fuse protection is disabled.

    Infeasible targets are not an error: if the window physically cannot
    reach `end_soe_target` from the caller's start SOE (rate limits, the
    inverter AC cap, solar), backward induction still returns a usable
    table, but `V[0]` at that start SOE carries the terminal penalty
    (`-PWL_TERMINAL_PENALTY_PER_KWH * shortfall`) instead of an
    economics-scale value. Callers must gate on
    `pwl_window_is_feasible(V, start_soe)` before splicing -- do not
    re-derive that threshold at the call site.

    An `end_soe_target` outside the battery's usable SOE range raises
    `ValueError` (see `_pinned_terminal_row`).

    Exhausting any of the accuracy budgets (`PWL_MAX_BREAKPOINTS`,
    `PWL_MAX_REFINE_ITERS`, `PWL_MAX_PREIMAGE_SEED_POINTS`,
    `PWL_MAX_EVAL_CELLS`) raises
    `PWLWindowUnderRefinedError` rather than returning the approximation --
    unlike infeasibility, an uncertifiable table has no honest use, and
    splicing one in as if exact is the silent degradation this whole path
    exists to remove.

    Mechanics: `V[0]` at `start_soe` is `economics - PWL_TERMINAL_PENALTY_PER_KWH
    x shortfall`, where `shortfall` is how far outside the pin band the best
    reachable end SOE lands. Window economics are at most a few hundred SEK,
    so a value at or below `PWL_WINDOW_INFEASIBLE_SEK` (-1e4 SEK, i.e. a
    `PWL_WINDOW_MAX_PIN_SHORTFALL_KWH` = 0.01 kWh shortfall) cannot be
    economics and must be penalty.

    The boundary is a continuum, not a cliff -- a shortfall just under
    `PWL_WINDOW_MAX_PIN_SHORTFALL_KWH` returns True with several thousand SEK
    of penalty still in `V[0]`, so that number is *not* a usable estimate of
    the window's economics. That is deliberate and safe: the threshold sits
    an order of magnitude below `SOE_STEP_KWH`, the grid DP's own state
    resolution, so any miss this predicate accepts is smaller than the
    reconnection point's own quantisation. Use it as a splice/don't-splice
    gate only; take the window's economics from the replayed rewards.
