"""The single candidate enumeration + evaluation + selection implementation
(principle P1, `docs/agents/optimizer-architecture.md`).

Every pass that has to *choose* a battery action calls `select_action`,
parameterized by a continuation-value evaluator `eval_V(next_soe)` and its
local slope: the grid DP's forward replay evaluates V by interpolating a
grid row, the PWL window's forward replay evaluates the same objective
against a piecewise-linear row. Nothing else differs between them, which is
why they were two hand-mirrored 200-line functions until Phase 1 of
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-09-optimizer-target-architecture.md` --
kept in sync by "mirror" comments and by whoever remembered to read them.
Adding a candidate type, guard, cap or preference to one of those and
missing the other is the #236 bug class; here it is unrepresentable.

The two *backward* passes -- `dp_battery_algorithm._run_dynamic_programming`
and `pwl_window_dp._pwl_candidate_values_at` -- keep their own numpy
evaluators for speed (P1 permits this explicitly: they estimate V over a
whole state grid at once and never emit an action). They consume this
module's candidate-space definitions -- `_residual_cover_p`,
`_discharge_is_unexecutable`, `_solar_export_bypass_is_unexecutable` -- and
the platform lattice from
`execution_model.PlatformCapabilities` rather than restating them, so the
action space itself has one definition even where the evaluation loop does
not.

    """Is this discharge one no inverter can actually carry out as commanded?

    True when the commanded discharge overshoots the home deficit by less than
    `GRID_FLOW_RESOLUTION_KWH`. Such an action is unexecutable on every
    platform, for two different reasons that happen to coincide:

    - Load-following firmware simply throttles it back to the deficit
      (`inverter_simulator.mode_to_power`: `min(deficit, rate_kw * dt, ...)`),
      so the overshoot never leaves the property.
    - Hardware that would deliver it produces an export below the resolution
      of the energy counters that measure exports, so `EnergyData`'s noise
      fold (#350) attributes it back to the home regardless.

    Excluding these is the whole of the #497 fix. Proposing one anyway meant
    the DP priced an export that never happened and drew energy from the
    battery that never left it, emitting a period whose reported flows did not
    add up. Every earlier attempt patched a consequence instead -- #240 zeroed
    the export *credit* in the reward and left the *energy* overstated, which
    is precisely the band this predicate removes. Nothing downstream needs a
    threshold now, so none of them have to be kept in sync with each other.

    The lower boundary deliberately mirrors `EnergyData`'s fold condition
    (`battery_to_home > 0`, models.py): the band starts at any positive
    deficit at all, not at `POWER_TOLERANCE_KW` -- the fold has no such
    stand-down, so neither can this.

    The upper boundary is inclusive (`<=`) even though the fold's own bound
    is strict (`< GRID_FLOW_RESOLUTION_KWH`) -- deliberately, as float
    safety margin, not drift. At an overshoot of exactly the resolution the
    two sites compute the same physical quantity through different float
    paths (this predicate subtracts powers, the fold subtracts energies),
    and they can land on opposite sides of the boundary: measured on
    synthetic_seasonal_summer period 16, the DP saw overshoot 0.1 + 1e-16
    ("real export") while the fold saw battery_to_grid 0.1 - 2e-17 (folded
    to zero), yielding a period whose planned 0.16 SEK export revenue
    load-first execution never delivers. Excluding the exact boundary costs
    at most one marginal export candidate; admitting it re-opens the #497
    incoherence at float precision.

    Accepts a scalar or an array; returns the matching shape. Both the replay
    candidate set (`_discharge_candidates`) and the PWL window's feasibility
    mask (`pwl_window_dp._pwl_candidate_values_at`) route through here, so the
    two action-choosing passes cannot drift onto different action sets -- the
    failure mode `_backward_discharge_levels`' docstring warns about. The
    coarse-grid backward pass is the one deliberate exception: it only
    estimates V, never emits an action, and keeping in-band grid points there
    approximates the exact-cover breakpoint its lattice lacks -- see the
    comment at its feasibility mask in `_run_dynamic_programming`.

    out as commanded this period? (#630)

    The bypass holds SoE exactly and lets the period's own solar surplus
    export instead of passively charging. Nothing commands that directly --
    it is delivered by `classify_strategic_intent` labelling the period
    SOLAR_EXPORT, which is the intent that writes charge rate 0 and so stops
    the inverter absorbing the surplus. That label needs
    `grid_exported > FLOW_NOISE_FLOOR_KWH`; at or below it the period falls
    through to IDLE, whose command is `load_first` at charge rate 100 --
    which absorbs. So the plan books export revenue on energy the hardware
    puts in the battery, and the battery runs fuller than planned until it
    hits a bound and spills the difference (#630: +0.0016 SEK over one
    quarterly day, from a single 0.0034 kWh surplus).

    This is the charge-side twin of `_residual_cover_p`'s first gate, which
    excludes discharges the same classifier would call IDLE (the #282 shape),
    and it gates on the same constant for the same reason -- one threshold,
    so the candidate space and the classifier cannot drift apart.

    Withholding the candidate is always safe: plain IDLE is offered
    unconditionally, and wherever the bypass diverts nothing (no surplus, or
    a battery already at `max_soe`) the two coincide exactly -- the same
    duplication `_tie_margin` already documents.

    Scalar per period, not per state: with no battery flow at all,
    `_ac_flows` reads only solar, load and the AC cap, so the export this
    candidate produces does not depend on SoE. The backward passes evaluate
    it once for the whole bypass column rather than per grid state.

    The AC cap is derived here rather than accepted as an argument, even
    though all three call sites already hold the identical value. That
    repeated call is deliberate, for the reason `_period_flows`' docstring
    gives: a cap passed in is a cap a caller can get wrong, and gating this
    candidate under a different cap than `_period_flows` prices it under is
    the reward-vs-flows divergence P4 exists to remove. One derivation per

    The percent lattice is coarse, and the net load almost never lands on
    it. Whenever it does not, no lattice action covers the house exactly:
    the step below under-covers and imports the difference at buy price,
    and every step above either is excluded by `_discharge_is_unexecutable`
    (#497) or exports for real at sell price. With buy > sell that is a
    forced loss in both directions, and which one the DP takes is decided
    by the tariff rather than by intent.

    On ceiling hardware the missing action is not merely desirable, it is
    directly commandable. `load_first` delivers `min(ceiling, actual load)`,
    so writing the smallest lattice step at or above the residual
    (`PlatformCapabilities.covering_ceiling_kw`) delivers the residual
    *exactly* (`inverter_simulator.py::mode_to_power`; VPP LOAD_SUPPORT is
    rate-less load-following, #413). The plan is the delivery; the command
    is on the lattice. That is what keeps exact plan-faithfulness, and it is
    why this is a candidate rather than a post-hoc demotion of the export.

    **This was previously offered only below the smallest lattice step**,
    which made it look like a narrow #466 special case. It was not: at
    `regression_2026_08_12_202906` period 99 the house needs 2.80 kW, the
    lattice offers 2.70 and 2.85, #497 removes 2.85/3.00/3.15, and the DP
    took 3.30 kW -- exporting 0.125 kWh, which classified the period
    BATTERY_EXPORT and wrote `grid_first` at a sub-load rate, forfeiting
    2.925 kWh of load-following headroom for 0.33 SEK. That is #352 Shape B,
    and it is what an absent candidate looks like from the outside. Removing
    the below-lattice restriction is the fix (design doc section 2, "the root
    cause is a missing candidate"); the DP is left to choose, and it chooses
    cover because cover is cheaper.

    Three executability gates, each verified against the execution path
    rather than assumed:

    - `residual * dt > FLOW_NOISE_FLOOR_KWH`:
      `classify_strategic_intent` labels a discharge LOAD_SUPPORT only above
      its `battery_discharged > 0.01` kWh noise floor -- at or below it the
      period classifies IDLE and the command mapper discharges nothing
      (R != P, the #282 failure shape).
    - `residual > POWER_CLASSIFICATION_THRESHOLD_KW`: the same classifier
      treats any *magnitude* at or below the threshold as noise, whatever
      its energy. This is stated directly now; before 4b it was enforced as
      a side effect of the nearest-rounding gate below, which rejected
      sub-half-step residuals because they wrote 0%.
    - a covering ceiling exists on this platform (`covering_ceiling_kw`).
      This replaces the old `residual <= round(residual / rate_step) *
      rate_step` gate, which existed because the write path rounded to
      nearest and a ceiling rounded *down* under-delivers the plan (repro:
      residual 0.12 kW -> 1% of 10 kW = 0.10 kW ceiling -> realized 0.10 for
      a planned 0.12). The write path now rounds ceilings up
      (`execution_model.command_index`), so the whole round-DOWN
      band is executable and the gate reduces to "is the ceiling
      commandable at all", i.e. at or below 100%. Rejecting 39% of the
      corpus's deficits was never the intent; it was the conversion's
      rounding direction showing through into the action space.

    **Only where a LOAD_SUPPORT discharge is actually delivered as
    `min(plan, actual load)`** (#580, Phase 4a). The paragraph above is the
    whole argument for this candidate: the plan is the *delivery*, and it is
    exact only if the hardware throttles to the real load. On native SolaX
    LOAD_SUPPORT is a forced `-(rate% x max_discharge)`, and on the
    period-list platforms (Growatt SPH, Solis, Huawei) there is no
    per-period control at all -- planning a partial cover there is planning
    a delivery that will not happen, the #282 shape. Before 4a the candidate
    was added unconditionally, which is what #580 records.

    Note this is `load_support_delivers_exact_cover`, **not**
    `discharge_rate_is_load_following`: on solax-modbus Growatt in VPP mode
    the rate register is a forced power, but LOAD_SUPPORT writes no rate --
    #413 releases the period to the inverter's own load-following self-use,
    so the cover is delivered exactly and the candidate belongs there.
    Gating on the register's semantics would have silently withdrawn #466's
    sunrise-crossover saving from that platform. Gated once, where the
    candidate is defined, rather than at each of the four call sites.

#    when the CHOSEN action is a large discharge and the alternative is
#    the far-away no-discharge state, never when the chosen action is
#    itself a charge.
# 2. TODO: it is an absolute kWh figure that scales with neither battery
#    capacity nor dt. Every fixture in the suite uses a similar-sized
#    battery, so no test can catch this. On a much smaller battery (say

    every entry here is an action the plan may actually take.

    A raw best-minus-second-best gap over the full candidate list is not a
    usable ambiguity signal, because several of those candidates are the
    same decision expressed twice:

    - IDLE and the SOLAR_EXPORT-below-max candidate coincide exactly
      whenever there is no solar surplus to route differently (both hold
      soe, both score identically) -- a margin of 0.0 that says nothing
      about ambiguity;
    - adjacent discharge breakpoints can sit a fraction of a grid step
      apart, which the grid DP's SOE_STEP_KWH-resolution value table cannot
      even distinguish.

    The alternatives that matter for #450 are ones landing at a materially
    different SOE -- e.g. charging in this window versus a later one. So a
    candidate only counts as a runner-up if its next_soe differs from the
