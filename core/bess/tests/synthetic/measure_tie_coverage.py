    measuring one answers nothing about coverage (that case is the rig's
    self-consistency control, not its measurement). The interesting period is
    the nearest *miss* -- the decision the detector came closest to catching
    and didn't -- because that is where a silently-wrong choice is most likely
    to still be worth real money.

    "Closest" is `tie_margin / epsilon`, epsilon being `tie_detection`'s own
    per-period threshold (`TIE_NOISE_FACTOR x soe_step x |dV/dSoE|`), so the
    ratio is a distance to the *detector's* boundary and 1.0 is exactly the

    divides by the raw snap noise (no `TIE_NOISE_FACTOR`) to describe the
    theoretical noise floor. Same margins, two deliberately different
    denominators: this one asks "how close to being flagged", that one asks
    "how close to being genuinely reorderable".

    Two period kinds can never be selected, mirroring the detector's own
    documented blind spots: a zero epsilon (flat value function) and an
    infinite margin (no behaviourally distinct alternative to compare
    against) both make the ratio meaningless rather than large. They are
    skipped rather than sorted to the end -- a blind spot is not a near miss,

    no period yields a formable ratio, returns `None`: "this scenario has
    nothing measurable", which callers must report as such rather than
    substituting an arbitrary segment.

    `pad` matches `detect_tie_windows`' default so the measured segment is
    exactly the one production would have re-solved -- that identity is what
    makes the resulting delta a genuine counterfactual ("what flagging this

    """Objective cost over `segment` as re-solved by the continuous-SOE PWL
    DP, pinned to the schedule's own SOE at both ends.

    NOT A PROVEN OPTIMUM, and the difference is load-bearing for how a caller
    may phrase a delta. This is "what the PWL solver achieves on these
    periods", not "what the best possible schedule costs" -- the solve is
    exact only to the solver's own `PWL_EPS_REFINE` certification, and the
    representation is piecewise linear over a value function that genuinely
    jumps at discharge-feasibility onsets.

    It used to be materially suboptimal on real data: on
    `historical_2024_08_16_high_spread_no_solar` segment 7-12 it returned
    42.679610 SEK against a DP path costing 42.648857 -- 0.031 SEK *worse*.
    That was a defect in `_pwl_candidate_values_at`, whose discharge-rate
    feasibility mask lacked the percent-lattice slack the replay's
    `_discharge_candidates` applies, so the backward pass silently refused
    levels the replay would have taken at states a floating-point hair below
    an onset. Fixed (#450); the same segment now returns 42.639365, i.e. the
    reference beats the DP. Pinned by
    `test_reference_does_not_undershoot_the_hybrid_on_the_regression_segment`.

    Reading a delta (`hybrid_cost - reference_cost`) in light of that:
    - POSITIVE is a sound constructive witness. The reference is a concrete
      feasible schedule with identical endpoints, replayed through the DP's
      own reward function, so a positive delta proves the DP left that much on
      the table -- whether or not the PWL solver found the true optimum.
    - NEGATIVE means the PWL solver undershot on this segment, so there is
      nothing for a caller to investigate and it must not be reported as a
      negative saving. Post-fix this should only occur at certification scale
      (~`PWL_EPS_REFINE`); a materially negative delta is now a signal that
      the two passes have drifted apart again, not ordinary solver noise.
    - Either way the magnitude is a LOWER BOUND on the true miss cost: pinning
      both ends forbids the reference from banking energy differently outside
      the segment, so a better global plan needing a different boundary SOE is
      out of reach by construction.

    Scope: this answers "what would re-solving these periods have been worth,
    holding everything outside them fixed" -- the counterfactual value of
    flagging one period -- not "what would a globally optimal schedule have
    cost". Reporting it as the total cost of a missed tie would overstate what
    was verified.

    That scoping is forced, not chosen. The solver's breakpoint set
    compounds per backward step (it seeds every discharge preimage of the next
    row's breakpoints), exhausting `PWL_MAX_PREIMAGE_SEED_POINTS` at a horizon
    of 8 periods on the #450 fixture -- a 78-period exact solve is not
    reachable by raising budgets. See
    `test_segment_reference_refuses_a_segment_longer_than_the_solver_can_certify`.
    The upside of the constraint is that cost is independent of the scenario's
    length: a 192-period scenario measures exactly as fast as a 24-period one.

    Pinning to the incumbent SOE at both ends is the same technique the
    production hybrid path uses when it splices a re-solved window
    (`dp_battery_algorithm.py` Step 2b).

    A segment may legitimately overlap a window the hybrid already resolved
    with this same solver; the delta is then zero by construction. That is a
    correct result, not a measurement -- such a segment carries no information
    about detector coverage, since the detector did catch it.

    `soe_trajectory` is the schedule's realized SOE per period boundary,
    length `horizon + 1`; the pins are read from it at `segment.start` and
    `segment.end`. Pass the *post-splice* trajectory (from
    `result.period_data`), not `tie_diagnostics["soe_trajectory"]`, which is
    recorded before the hybrid splices and so differs inside a resolved
    window.

    `cost_basis` should be the basis entering `segment.start` (from
    `replay_schedule`), but the returned cost does not depend on it: it is
    threaded only for parity with production's `resolve_pwl_window` call.
    `_compute_reward`'s `total_cost` is import cost minus export revenue plus
    wear, none of which read the basis -- the basis is carried for
    profitability reporting and rolls forward as `new_cost_basis`. Verified by
    `test_reference_cost_does_not_depend_on_cost_basis`; do not infer from
    this parameter that a mis-seeded basis would corrupt a measurement.

    The returned number is directly comparable to a slice of
    `replay_schedule`'s `period_costs`: same accumulation (negated
    `_compute_reward`, summed), and terminal value enters neither, so equal
    end SOE makes the comparison exact.

    Raises `PWLWindowUnderRefinedError` if the segment is too long for the
    solver to certify, and `RuntimeError` if the pinned end SOE is
    unreachable. Neither is caught here: an uncertifiable or infeasible table
    has no honest use as a reference, and a caller that swallowed either would
    report a fabricated 0.00 SEK delta.

    detector coverage". `zero_epsilon_periods` / `total_periods` distinguish
