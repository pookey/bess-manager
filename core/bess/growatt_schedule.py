"""Growatt schedule management module with Strategic Intent Conversion.

This module converts strategic intents from the DP algorithm into Growatt-specific
Time of Use (TOU) intervals while meeting strict inverter hardware requirements.

PROBLEM STATEMENT & REQUIREMENTS:

Growatt inverters have strict hardware requirements that create operational challenges:
1. TOU segments must be in chronological order without overlaps (hardware requirement)
2. Maximum 9 TOU segments supported by inverter hardware
3. Frequent inverter writes should be minimized to reduce hardware stress
4. Past and future strategic periods can change dynamically throughout the day, but we only update future segments
5. Past time intervals should not be modified (unnecessary writes)
6. All segments must have unique, sequential segment IDs (1, 2, 3...)
7. Segment durations must align with full hour boundaries (e.g., 20:00-20:59)
8. Inverter default behavior is load_first - only create TOU segments to override this default
9. Only strategic periods (battery_first, grid_first) need explicit TOU segments
10. IDLE periods automatically use load_first behavior (no TOU segment required)

OBJECTIVES:

1. ZERO OVERLAPS: Guarantee no overlapping time intervals
2. CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER: Ensure segments are always in time sequence (1,2,3...)
3. MINIMAL WRITES: Only update future segments, preserve past segments unchanged
4. HARDWARE COMPATIBILITY: Respect 9-segment limit and ID requirements
5. DP ALIGNMENT: Use full hour boundaries to align with DP algorithm output

APPROACH:

Strategic intents (from DP algorithm) are converted to battery modes:
- GRID_CHARGING → battery_first (AC charging enabled)
- SOLAR_STORAGE → battery_first (charging priority)
- LOAD_SUPPORT → load_first (discharging priority)
- EXPORT_ARBITRAGE → grid_first (export priority)
- IDLE → load_first (normal operation)

ALGORITHM:

1. Group consecutive hours by battery mode
2. Create TOU intervals only for non-"load_first" modes (battery_first, grid_first)
3. Use full hour boundaries (e.g., 20:00-20:59) to align with DP algorithm output
4. Preserve past intervals to minimize inverter writes
5. Assign sequential segment IDs to avoid conflicts

IMPLEMENTATION VALIDATION:

Requirements compliance check:
✓ Zero overlaps: Uses hour boundaries (20:00-20:59, 21:00-21:59) - no overlap possible
✓ Chronological order: Final intervals sorted by start_time, sequential IDs assigned 1,2,3...
✓ Minimal writes: Preserves past intervals unchanged
✓ Hardware compatibility: Limits to max 9 segments, ensures unique sequential IDs
✓ DP alignment: Uses exact hour boundaries from DP algorithm
✓ Disabled segments are load_first: Time periods without TOU segments default to load_first
✓ Corruption recovery: Nuclear reset approach when chaos detected

CORRECT APPROACH: Only create TOU segments for strategic periods (battery_first, grid_first).
All other time periods automatically use load_first as inverter default behavior.

ROBUST RECOVERY: When TOU corruption detected (overlaps, wrong order, duplicates):
1. Log corrupted state for debugging
2. Clear all corrupted TOU intervals immediately
3. If strategic intents available, rebuild schedule immediately
4. System instantly returns to clean, working state

        Growatt inverters support a maximum of 9 TOU segments. When 15-minute

        Strategy: Keep longest segments (duration-based priority)
        ----------------------------------------------------------
        Rationale: Longer segments represent more sustained battery actions
        and typically have greater economic impact. Short segments often
        arise from transient price fluctuations.

        Alternative strategies considered:
        - Mode priority (GRID_CHARGING > EXPORT_ARBITRAGE > others): Would
          preserve arbitrage opportunities but might drop long idle periods
          that are actually important for battery preservation.
        - Chronological (keep earliest): Simple but ignores segment importance.
        - Economic value: Would require price data access at this layer.

        The duration-based approach balances simplicity with effectiveness.
        In practice, hitting the 9-segment limit is rare with typical price
        patterns (usually 3-6 mode transitions per day).
