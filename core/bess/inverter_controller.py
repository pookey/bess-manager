    charging so solar bypasses to grid even when the battery has room --
    unlike IDLE, which is meant to pass through to hardware's normal
    self-use charging. Before #313 these were identical (charge_rate=100),
    harmless while SOLAR_EXPORT only ever occurred with a full battery
    (nothing left to charge anyway either way), but wrong once the DP can
    choose SOLAR_EXPORT below max SOE.
