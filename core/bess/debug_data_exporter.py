"""Debug data export functionality for comprehensive troubleshooting.

This module produces a single markdown file (compact=True by default) that serves
three distinct debugging use cases, all via the same export endpoint.

## Use Case 1 — Exact scenario replay

Reproduce any user's real-world scenario on a local development machine.
Required data: entity_snapshot (full raw HA state, verbatim mock-HA input),
addon_options (entity ID mappings and inverter config), inverter_tou_segments
(current hardware TOU state), historical_periods full JSON (seeds the in-memory
historical store), and price_data (raw pre-markup prices).

This is why the compact export embeds full JSON inside <details> collapsibles for
entity_snapshot, historical_periods, and schedules — the tables are for human
reading, the JSON is machine input for from_debug_log.py.

## Use Case 2 — AI behaviour analysis via bess-analyst + MCP server

Fetch the export from a production system and ask: "Why did we have a series of
small discharges between 07:00 and 08:45 — is this financially optimal?"

The AI needs: compact key-event logs (not the raw 200+ KB full log), the latest
schedule rendered as a period-decisions table, historical_periods as an observation
table (planned intent vs observed intent vs actual energy flows), and settings.
The full JSON collapsibles are present but the AI works from the tables.

## Use Case 3 — Prediction drift analysis throughout the day

The 00:00 optimization predicted 100 SEK savings; by 18:00 only 60 SEK was
realised. Was this a bug, a bad battery action, or just external environmental
change (less sun, higher consumption than predicted)?

Required data: ALL prediction snapshots as an evolution table (one compact row
per hourly optimization run, showing total_savings, actual_count, predicted_count)
combined with the historical_periods observation table. Together these let the
analyst trace whether the gap appeared early (environmental) or late (control
error). No full snapshot JSON is needed — the 5-field evolution table is enough.

## compact=True vs compact=False

compact=True  - default; serves all three use cases; targets ~200-500 KB.
compact=False — raw full dump; complete log, all schedules, all snapshots as JSON;
                use when a specific field not present in compact mode is needed.

                summary fields (timestamp, period, predicted_savings,
                actual_count, predicted_count) for the full-day evolution
                table, PLUS that run's own forward-looking forecast
                (`predicted_periods_delta`, drawn from the periods with
                data_source == "predicted", i.e. every period NOT already realized at that
                run's own decision time -- exact buy/sell/solar/consumption/
                SOE/shadow_price/intent, not the rounded box-table version).
                Already-realized periods are deliberately excluded: they're
                the same data every earlier snapshot that day would also
                carry, and are already exported in full once, at exact
                precision, in Historical Sensor Data -- repeating them per
                snapshot would be pure duplication for no analytical value,
                since a past period's *actual* outcome doesn't change
                between snapshots (only the forecast for what's still ahead
                does). This is what makes two runs' schedules actually
                diffable: `optimize_battery_schedule()`'s own forward
                horizon input, not a log line.

                The forecast is emitted as `predicted_periods_delta`: for each
                period that moved, only the FIELDS that moved (plus `period`
                to key it) -- see `_period_delta`. Alongside it,
                `predicted_periods_dropped` lists the period indices that left
                the forecast entirely (they realized into actuals). A period's
                first appearance carries its complete payload, so there is
                always a baseline to replay onto. A reader reconstructs any
                snapshot's complete forecast by deep-merging each delta over
                the accumulated state, keyed by period index, and deleting the
                dropped indices. An empty delta means the plan didn't move
                that cycle. Both halves are needed: the forecast window shrinks
                every cycle, and a departure has no delta entry to carry it,
                so deltas alone reconstruct a forecast that never shrinks.

                Deduping per snapshot instead of per period (what this did
                before #555) was nearly useless in practice: a single
                marginal period flips on most cycles, and one flip
                re-serialized the entire remaining forecast. On the reference
                bundle that wrote 4,275 period objects to carry 314 periods'
                worth of actual change -- 6.78 MB of a 9.04 MB export. The
                key is deliberately NOT named `predicted_periods`: bundles
                already attached to issues use that name for a *whole*
                forecast, and they are regression fixtures, so the two
                encodings must stay distinguishable by key rather than
                silently redefining one. The evolution
                table's summary fields are never deltaed -- every run still
                gets its own row there regardless.
                If False, return full snapshot data (all periods, actual and
                predicted) for all snapshots, no deduplication.
