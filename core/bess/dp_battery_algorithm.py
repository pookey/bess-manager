Dynamic Programming Algorithm for Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) Optimization.

This module implements a sophisticated dynamic programming approach to optimize battery
dispatch decisions over a 24-hour horizon, considering time-varying electricity prices,
solar production forecasts, and home consumption patterns.

UPDATED: Now captures strategic intent at decision time rather than analyzing flows afterward.

ALGORITHM OVERVIEW:
The optimization uses backward induction dynamic programming to find the globally optimal
battery charging and discharging schedule. At each hour, the algorithm evaluates all
possible battery actions (charge/discharge/hold) and selects the one that minimizes
total cost over the remaining time horizon.

KEY FEATURES:
- 24-hour optimization horizon with perfect foresight
- Cost basis tracking for stored energy (FIFO accounting)
- Multi-objective optimization: cost minimization + battery longevity
- Simultaneous energy flow optimization across multiple sources/destinations
- Strategic intent capture at decision time for transparency and hardware control

STRATEGIC INTENT CAPTURE:
The algorithm now captures the strategic reasoning behind each decision:
- GRID_CHARGING: Storing cheap grid energy for arbitrage
- SOLAR_STORAGE: Storing excess solar for later use
- LOAD_SUPPORT: Discharging to meet home load
- BATTERY_EXPORT: Discharging to grid for profit
- IDLE: No significant activity

ENERGY FLOW MODELING:
The algorithm models complex energy flows where multiple sources can serve multiple
destinations simultaneously:
- Solar → {Home, Battery, Grid Export}
- Battery → {Home, Grid Export}
- Grid → {Home, Battery Charging}

OPTIMIZATION OBJECTIVES:
1. Primary: Minimize total electricity costs over 24-hour period
2. Secondary: Minimize battery degradation through cycle cost modeling
3. Constraints: Physical battery limits, efficiency losses, minimum SOC

RETURN STRUCTURE:
The algorithm returns comprehensive results including:
- Optimal battery actions for each hour
- Strategic intent for each decision
- Detailed energy flow breakdowns showing where each kWh flows
- Economic analysis comparing different scenarios
- All data needed for hardware implementation and performance analysis

    Calculate the next state of energy based on current SOE and power action.

    EFFICIENCY HANDLING:
    - Charging: power x dt x efficiency = energy actually stored
    - Discharging: power x dt / efficiency = energy removed from storage
    This ensures that efficiency losses are properly accounted for in energy balance.

    PASSIVE SOLAR CHARGING (IDLE):
    When power=0, excess solar (production - consumption) passively charges the
    battery up to capacity, clamped by the inverter's max charge rate. This models
    the economically correct baseline: free solar energy is more valuable stored
    for later use than exported at the (typically lower) sell price.

    `ac_cap_kwh` is a live footgun and callers should pass
    `_effective_ac_cap_kwh(battery_settings, dt)` rather than omitting it. It is
    read only inside the `import_cap_kwh` branch, to throttle grid charging
    against the house fuse (#429), so a caller that passes an import cap while
    omitting this one computes `next_soe` under a different inverter limit than
    `_period_flows` derives for the very same action -- the reward-vs-flows
    divergence P4 exists to remove.

    It cannot be asserted away, which is the trap: `_effective_ac_cap_kwh`
    returns None for a battery with no AC cap configured, so None is a
    legitimate value here and is indistinguishable from a forgotten argument.
    The real remedy is to derive the cap inside this function, as
    `_period_flows` and `_price_flows` now do -- deferred rather than done here
    only because this is the bit-parity-pinned physics core the migration plan
    says to refactor around. Today `select_action` is the only caller passing an
    import cap and it passes the derived value, so nothing is presently wrong.

    leaving `shadow_price` at its 0.0 default, which every consumer read as
    "stored energy is worthless" and used to open the sub-period discharge
    ceiling on a value that had never been computed (#526).

    The authorization is decided here instead, where the value function is

    the battery is not in -- so the reported slope stepped mid-cell instead of
    at cell boundaries, and the gate reads that number raw. It now reads the
    interpolant like every other consumer.

    #683 then widened *how much* of the interpolant it reads: one cell is a poor
    estimate of a staircase, so the price is taken across the whole span a

    Run backward induction DP to compute optimal battery control policy.

    Also considers, per period, a residual load-cover column: discharge
    exactly the forecast net load wherever the lattice cannot represent
    covering it (see _residual_cover_p) -- so the value function knows
    holding, under-covering and over-covering are not the only options,
    keeping V consistent with the replay pass whose candidate set
    (_discharge_candidates) contains the same action. Added for the
    sunrise/sunset crossover (#466) and extended to every such period by
    Phase 4b (#352).

    `import_cap_kwh` and `min_grid_export_kwh`, when given, hold one entry per
    period. Both are masked per state exactly as `select_action` filters its
    candidates -- import cap first, then minimum export -- so V values only
    policies the forward replay can execute (P1).

    Also considers, at every state, a distinct SOLAR_EXPORT-below-max
    candidate (#313) -- battery SOE held exactly unchanged (no passive
    charge) while this period's own solar surplus exports directly -- as an
    alternative to IDLE's forced full passive charge. Without this, IDLE's
    mandatory charge conflates "let solar bypass the battery" with "how much
    room to keep" into one decision, forcing a genuinely necessary
    headroom-creating action into whichever period first needs the room
    even when a better-priced, side-effect-free slot for it existed earlier
    in the same horizon. See

    This replaced a one-cell backward difference, which answered in a different
    unit (per kWh of *SoE*) and, in the discharge-limited regime, answered even
    that inaccurately -- the latter being the actual #683 defect. The old rule
    `buy * eta >= dV/dSoE` was itself dimensionally sound; what it could not
    survive was a bad reading of `dV/dSoE`. `SOE_STEP_KWH` equals
    `POWER_STEP_KW * dt`, while converting SoE into delivery carries
    `efficiency_discharge`. So V is a staircase whose riser is one whole delivery
    step and which is flat once every `1/(1-eta)` cells: a one-cell backward
    difference lands on a riser 19 times out of 20 and reports the *undiscounted*
    price, and on the flat cell reports zero.

    Pricing the delivery instead removes the artifact rather than compensating for
    it. Delivering `SOE_STEP_KWH` costs `SOE_STEP_KWH / eta` of SoE, which spans
    1/eta cells -- just over one -- so the interpolant is read across exactly the
    span the discharge consumes, and the staircase averages out by construction
    instead of 19 times in 20.

    That averaging does not hold in the bottom cell. For a grid index below `1/eta`,
    `soe - SOE_STEP_KWH/eta` falls under `min_soe_kwh`, where `_interpolate_value`
    extrapolates on the `V[0]->V[1]` gradient (#336); the result then collapses
    algebraically to that one cell's slope divided by eta, with no averaging. This is
    not a regression -- it is exactly what the previous estimator returned there, and
    the rule change compensates for it identically (`buy >= g/eta` is `buy*eta >= g`)
    -- but it does mean a flat bottom cell still prices at 0.0 and opens the gate. The
    `None` guard above only covers index 0 itself (#526).

    The result is denominated per delivered kWh, the same unit as `buy_price`, so
    the gate's comparison needs no efficiency factor: covering `dE` now consumes
    `dE/eta` of SoE, which would later have delivered `dE` anyway, so the
    opportunity cost is `dE * p_future` and eta cancels on both sides.

    optimize_battery_schedule's selection loop describes the *pre-splice*
    trajectory and must be recomputed. The no-tie path never calls this, so its
    output is bit-for-bit whatever the selection loop produced.

    Only the *prices* are re-applied here. The flows are the records the
    selection loop and the PWL window solve already produced, spliced
    together by `splice_schedule` and priced through `_price_flows` -- this
    pass never re-derives physics (P4). Re-deriving would be a second
    derivation of a trajectory whose actions were chosen elsewhere, and it is
    why this function no longer takes `import_cap_kwh`: the cap shaped
    `grid_to_battery` when the flows were produced, and a replay handed a
    different cap than the solve ran under would otherwise have silently
    priced a period the plan never contained.

    Costs are chained rather than stored: `cost_basis` depends on the
    preceding period's outcome, which splicing changes, so it is the one
    quantity that genuinely must be recomputed here.

    Battery optimization that eliminates dual cost calculation by using
    DP-calculated PeriodData directly in simulation.

    Args:
        buy_price: List of electricity buy prices for each period
        sell_price: List of electricity buy prices for each period
        home_consumption: List of home consumption for each period (kWh)
        battery_settings: Battery configuration and limits
        solar_production: List of solar production for each period (kWh), defaults to 0
        initial_soe: Initial battery state of energy (kWh), defaults to min_soe
        initial_cost_basis: Initial cost basis for battery cycling, defaults to cycle_cost
        period_duration_hours: Duration of each period in hours (always 0.25 for quarterly resolution)
        terminal_curve: Concave valuation of usable energy remaining at end of
            horizon -- the buy-median rate up to the household's pre-dawn need,
            nothing above it. Prevents end-of-day dumping when tomorrow's prices
            aren't available yet, without the all-or-nothing midnight SOE a single
            rate produces (#602). Defaults to None (no terminal value).
        max_charge_power_per_period: Per-period max charge power limits (kW), typically
            from temperature derating. When provided, charging actions exceeding the
            limit for each period are excluded from the optimization. Defaults to None
            (no per-period limits, uses battery_settings.max_charge_power_kw).
        export_curtailment_active: Caller-computed, capability-aware flag for
            whether export-limit curtailment (#269) will actually execute --
            battery_settings.export_curtailment_enabled AND the platform
            supports it AND the entities are configured. Deliberately NOT
            read from battery_settings.export_curtailment_enabled directly:
            that's just the user's opt-in preference, and planning as if
            curtailment will happen on a platform/config that can't actually
            do it would make outcomes worse than leaving the feature off
            (the plan forgoes real defenses against a loss that never gets
            neutralized). Same call-site pattern as `capabilities` below:
            the caller reads the platform, the DP is told. Defaults to False.
        capabilities: What the executing platform can express -- discharge
            lattice, whether a discharge rate is a ceiling or a target, mode
            vocabulary, minimum gear (`execution_model.PlatformCapabilities`,
            Phase 4a / D2). `BatterySystemManager` builds it from the live
            controller; the default describes the TOU-register platform the DP
            assumed before 4a, so a caller without hardware plans exactly as
            it did before. It is one object rather than a kwarg per fact on
            purpose: two construction sites for the same platform is how the
            planner and the executor drifted apart in #282/#497/#511/#537.
        home_settings: Home electrical settings (fuse limit, voltage, phases). When
            `power_monitoring_enabled` is set, the DP derives a per-period grid-import
            energy cap and treats it as a hard physical constraint (#429): total import
            (house load + battery charging) may not exceed it, constraining rather than
            excluding a period whose load alone exceeds the cap. Defaults to None (no
            import cap, matching power_monitoring_enabled's own default of False).
        tie_diagnostics: Optional mutable dict. When provided, populated with the
            internal tie-margin/value-slope/window/SoE-trajectory data this
            function already computes, for offline measurement tooling (#450).
            Never passed by production callers; a pure no-op when omitted.
        min_grid_export_kwh_per_period: Per-period minimum grid export (kWh),
            one entry per period -- the Octopus Power Down export pulse. A
            constraint on flows, "constrain, don't raise" like the import cap:
            a period exports at least its target where some action can, and
            the most it can where none can. Solar surplus counts. Defaults to
            None (no minimum anywhere); a list of the wrong length raises
            ValueError.
        session_import_cap_kwh_per_period: Per-period grid-import cap (kWh),
            the Octopus Power Down session's own "no grid import in the
            window" constraint (element None = no session cap that period).
            Combined with the fuse cap (home_settings) by taking the tighter
            of the two per period -- a session period gets whichever is
            smaller, a non-session period keeps the fuse cap alone. Defaults
            to None (no session constraint anywhere); a list of the wrong
            length raises ValueError.

        #
        # The gap is pre-existing, not introduced here: `_build_period_data`
        # has always derived STORE throughput from `soe` via room/rate while
