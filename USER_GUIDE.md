## Dashboard Overview

### Main Dashboard

The main dashboard provides a real-time overview of your energy system:

#### System Status Card

- **Current SOC**: Battery charge percentage and energy (kWh)
- **Power Flows**: Real-time power in/out of battery, solar, and grid
- **System Health**: Green/Yellow/Red indicators for all components
- **Active Strategy**: Current optimization strategy (Grid Charging, Solar Storage, etc.)

#### Today's Energy Flows

- **Solar Production**: Total solar energy generated today
- **Home Consumption**: Energy consumed by your home
- **Battery Activity**: Energy charged/discharged
- **Grid Interaction**: Energy imported/exported
- **Savings**: Estimated cost savings vs. no optimization

### Understanding the Charts

#### 1. Energy Flow Chart (Sankey Diagram)

This beautiful flowing chart shows how energy moves through your system:

- **🌞 Solar → Home**: Direct solar consumption (best case)
- **🌞 Solar → Battery**: Solar energy stored for later
- **🌞 Solar → Grid**: Excess solar sold to grid
- **🔋 Battery → Home**: Stored energy powering your home
- **🔋 Battery → Grid**: Stored energy sold during peak prices
- **⚡ Grid → Home**: Direct grid consumption
- **⚡ Grid → Battery**: Grid energy stored during cheap periods

**Tip**: Thicker flows = more energy. Green flows = good (saving money), red flows = expensive.

#### 2. Battery Level Chart

Shows battery charge level throughout the day with strategic context:

- **Purple periods**: Grid charging (storing cheap electricity)
- **Yellow periods**: Solar storage (storing free solar energy)  
- **Blue periods**: Load support (using battery to power home)
- **Green periods**: Export arbitrage (selling stored energy for profit)
- **Gray periods**: Idle (no significant battery activity)

**Reading the strategy**:

- **GRID_CHARGING**: Buying cheap electricity to store
- **SOLAR_STORAGE**: Storing excess solar production
- **LOAD_SUPPORT**: Using battery to power your home
- **EXPORT_ARBITRAGE**: Selling stored energy at high prices

#### 3. Detailed Savings Analysis

Comprehensive breakdown of your savings:

- **Grid-Only Cost**: What you would pay without optimization
- **Optimized Cost**: Actual cost with BESS Manager
- **Total Savings**: Money saved (can be negative during investment periods)
- **ROI Tracking**: Progress toward return on investment

### Detailed System Status

The system status card provides key metrics and health information:

- **Battery SOC**: Current charge level (percentage and kWh)
- **Real-time Power**: Current power flows (solar, battery, grid, consumption)
- **System Health**: Component status indicators (sensors, integrations)
- **Today's Totals**: Energy flows and estimated savings for today
- **Strategic Intent**: Current optimization strategy being executed

## Understanding Optimization Strategies

- **Why**: Maximize revenue from stored energy
- **When**: Peak price hours when selling is more profitable
- **Indicator**: Battery discharging, high grid export

#### 😴 IDLE

- **What**: Minimal battery activity
- **Why**: No profitable charging/discharging opportunity
- **When**: Price differences too small to justify battery wear
- **Indicator**: Low battery activity, direct solar consumption

## Monitoring Performance

### Health Indicators

- **🟢 Green**: System operating normally
- **🟡 Yellow**: Minor issues or suboptimal conditions
- **🔴 Red**: Attention required (sensor offline, communication issues)

### Key Metrics to Watch

#### Daily Performance

- **Total Savings**: Daily cost reduction
- **Energy Efficiency**: How much energy was optimized vs. total consumption
- **Battery Utilization**: Percentage of battery capacity used effectively

#### Weekly/Monthly Trends

- **Savings Rate**: Percentage of electricity costs saved
- **ROI Progress**: Time to recover optimization system investment
- **Seasonal Variations**: How performance changes with weather patterns

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### View Logs for Troubleshooting

When reporting issues or debugging problems, check the add-on logs for detailed information:

1. Go to **Home Assistant** → **Settings** → **Add-ons** → **BESS Manager**
2. Click on the **Log** tab
3. Review the logs for errors or warnings

The logs show:

- Sensor data collection and validation
- Optimization algorithm decisions and reasoning
- Schedule creation and inverter communication
- Price data fetching and processing
- Component health checks and errors

**Tip**: Use the **Refresh** button to see the latest log entries. For historical logs, you can use the Home Assistant system log viewer.

### "No optimization happening"

**Symptoms**: Battery stays at same level, no strategic intents
**Causes**:

- Price differences too small to justify battery wear
- Battery already at optimal level
- System in learning mode (first few days)

**Solutions**:

- Check electricity price integration is working (Nordpool or Octopus Energy)
- Verify price spread is significant enough to justify battery wear
- Wait for price volatility periods

### "Savings are negative"

**Symptoms**: Dashboard shows negative savings
**Causes**:

- System is investing in battery charge for future savings
- Battery wear costs temporarily exceed immediate benefits
- Learning period with suboptimal decisions

**Solutions**:

- Look at weekly/monthly totals instead of daily
- Check if system is building charge for upcoming peak prices
- Verify battery wear cost settings are reasonable

### "Energy flows don't balance"

**Symptoms**: Energy in ≠ energy out in charts
**Causes**:

- Sensor timing differences
- InfluxDB data gaps
- Battery efficiency losses

**Solutions**:

- Check all sensors are reporting correctly
- Verify InfluxDB integration is working
- Small imbalances (<5%) are normal due to efficiency losses

### "Battery not following schedule"

**Symptoms**: Battery behavior doesn't match predicted schedule
**Causes**:

- Home consumption higher/lower than predicted
- Solar production different than forecast
- Grid power limitations
- Inverter safety overrides

**Solutions**:

- Check if actual consumption matches predictions
- Verify solar forecast accuracy
- Review inverter settings and error logs
- System will auto-adapt within 1-2 hours

## Optimizing Your Settings

### Battery Settings

- **Total Capacity**: Match your actual battery capacity exactly
- **Min SOC**: Set safety margin (10-20% recommended)
- **Cycle Cost**: Balance between battery wear and optimization aggressiveness

### Price Settings

- **Area**: Must match your pricing area (Nordpool area code, or "UK" for Octopus)
- **Additional Costs**: Include all taxes, fees, and markup for accurate calculations (set to 0 for Octopus as prices are VAT-inclusive)

### Consumption Strategy

BESS supports four consumption forecasting strategies, configured via `consumption_strategy` in the `home` section of your add-on config:

- **`sensor`** (default): Reads a 48h-average HA sensor. Simple, flat forecast. Works out of the box.
- **`fixed`**: Uses the `home.consumption` config value. No sensors needed. Good starting point.
- **`influxdb_profile`**: Queries InfluxDB for a 7-day average profile. Produces a shaped forecast reflecting your actual daily pattern (low at night, peaks at mealtimes). Requires InfluxDB with 1+ week of history.
- **`ml_prediction`**: Runs an XGBoost ML model with weather data. Most accurate, adapts to temperature and seasonal changes. Requires a trained model (see [ML README](ml/README.md)).

Start with `sensor` or `fixed` and upgrade to `influxdb_profile` or `ml_prediction` as you accumulate data. See the [Installation Guide](INSTALLATION.md) for detailed setup instructions for each strategy.
