# Changelog

All notable changes to BESS Battery Manager will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Unified energy provider configuration: replaced separate `nordpool:` and `octopus:` top-level sections with a single `energy_provider:` section containing `provider`, `nordpool`, `nordpool_official`, and `octopus` sub-keys.
- Moved Nordpool price sensor entity IDs (`nordpool_kwh_today`/`nordpool_kwh_tomorrow`) from `sensors:` into `energy_provider.nordpool` where they belong, since they are provider configuration not hardware sensor mappings.
- `HomeAssistantSource` now receives entity IDs directly via constructor instead of looking them up from the controller's sensor map at runtime.
- Widened `ElectricitySettings.area` TypeScript type from `'SE1' | 'SE2' | 'SE3' | 'SE4'` to `string` to support non-Swedish price areas (e.g. UK for Octopus Energy).

### Removed

- `use_official_integration` boolean from config (redundant with `provider` field).
- Dead code: `get_nordpool_prices_today()`/`get_nordpool_prices_tomorrow()` methods and their `METHOD_SENSOR_MAP` entries in `ha_api_controller.py` (unused in production, only called from test mock).
- Dead code: `LegacyNordpoolSource` class in `official_nordpool_source.py` (never imported or instantiated).

## [6.2.1] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- Octopus Energy prices no longer display at ~1.33 GBP/kWh. The `PriceManager` retained Swedish default pricing parameters (markup=0.08, VAT=1.25, additional=1.03) because `update_settings()` updated the settings dataclass but never propagated the new values to the running `PriceManager`. Settings are now forwarded and the price cache is cleared on update.
- Octopus Energy 30-minute rates are now expanded to 96 quarterly (15-minute) periods at the source level, ensuring correct timestamps and consistent resolution across all code paths. The previous normalization at the BSM level duplicated price-entry dicts which carried wrong timestamps.

## [6.2.0] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- InfluxDB queries now work with both 1.x and 2.x data models. In 1.x, `_measurement` holds the unit of measurement (e.g. `%`, `W`) and the entity ID is stored in an `entity_id` tag; in 2.x, `_measurement` holds the entity ID directly. Query filters now match on either field.
- CSV response parsers now detect column positions from the header row instead of using hardcoded indices, preventing silent data loss when InfluxDB returns columns in a different order depending on version and tag configuration.
- Diagnostic logging in batch queries uses header-aware column detection and logs raw response lines when zero sensors are found, making InfluxDB version mismatches immediately visible in logs.

## [6.1.3] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed

- Octopus Energy prices (48 half-hourly) are now normalized to 15-minute quarterly resolution before entering the optimization pipeline. The system internally uses 96 periods/day (15-min each) for period indices, historical store, and Growatt schedules. Passing 48-element price arrays caused `list assignment index out of range` when the 15-min period index (e.g. 90) exceeded the array size, preventing any optimization from running.

## [6.1.2] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed

- Inverter page no longer shows blank/zero data when the dashboard endpoint fails. Changed `Promise.all` to `Promise.allSettled` so each API fetch succeeds or fails independently. A failing `/api/dashboard` (e.g. when no optimization schedule exists) no longer discards successful results from inverter status, schedule, and battery settings endpoints.

## [6.1.1] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed

- `get_tomorrow_prices()` now catches `PriceDataUnavailableError` in addition to `ValueError`, so the "return empty list if not yet available" fallback actually works for Octopus Energy.
- Octopus Energy rate validation accepts 46-48 rates instead of requiring exactly 48. Octopus publishes rates incrementally and the last couple of half-hours may arrive slightly later.

## [6.1.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- Octopus Energy Agile tariff support as a new price source alongside Nordpool. Fetches import and export rates from HA event entities at 30-minute resolution with VAT-inclusive GBP/kWh prices.
- `price_provider` configuration field to select between `nordpool`, `nordpool_official`, and `octopus` price sources.
- Separate import and export rate entities for Octopus Energy, allowing direct sell price data instead of calculated fallback.
- `period_duration_hours` on `PriceSource` to support different rate resolutions (15-min Nordpool, 30-min Octopus).
- `get_sell_prices_for_date()` on `PriceSource` for sources that provide direct export/sell rates.
- Documentation for Octopus Energy setup in README, Installation Guide, and User Guide.

## [6.0.6] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed

- Historical data no longer shows as missing all day when InfluxDB is configured with InfluxDB 1.x (accessed via v2 compatibility API). The Flux query previously included a `domain == "sensor"` tag filter that is absent in 1.x setups, causing the batch query to silently return zero rows. The `_measurement` filter already uniquely identifies sensors, making the domain filter redundant.
- Batch sensor data that loads successfully but returns no periods is no longer cached, allowing the system to retry on the next 15-minute period rather than remaining stuck with an empty cache for the entire day.

## [6.0.5] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed

- System no longer crashes at startup if the inverter is temporarily unreachable when syncing SOC limits. A warning is logged and startup continues normally; the inverter retains its previous limits.

## [6.0.4] - 2026-02-08

### Added

- Compact mode for debug data export - reduces export size by including only latest schedule/snapshot and last 2000 log lines
- `compact` query parameter on `/api/export-debug-data` endpoint (defaults to `true`)

### Changed

- MCP server `fetch_live_debug` now uses `compact` parameter instead of `save_locally`
- Increased MCP server fetch timeout from 60s to 90s for large exports
- Raised `min_action_profit_threshold` default from 5.0 to 8.0 SEK

### Fixed

- Corrected `lifetime_load_consumption` sensor name in config.yaml (was pointing to daily sensor instead of lifetime)

## [6.0.0] - 2026-02-01

### Changed

- TOU scheduling now uses 15-minute resolution instead of hourly aggregation
- Eliminates "charging gaps" where minority intents were lost due to hourly majority voting
- Each 15-minute strategic intent period now directly maps to TOU segments
- Schedule comparison uses minute-level precision for accurate differential updates

### Added

- `_group_periods_by_mode()` groups consecutive 15-min periods by battery mode
- `_groups_to_tou_intervals()` converts period groups to Growatt TOU intervals
- `_enforce_segment_limit()` handles 9-segment hardware limit using duration-based priority
- DST handling for fall-back scenarios (100 periods) with proper time capping

### Fixed

- Single strategic period (e.g., 15-min GRID_CHARGING) now creates TOU segment instead of being outvoted
- Overlap detection uses minute-level precision instead of hour-level

## [5.7.0] - 2026-01-31

### Added

- MCP server for BESS debug log analysis - enables Claude Code to fetch and analyze debug logs directly
- Token-based authentication for debug export API endpoint (for external/programmatic access)

- Prevents feedback loop where observed exports were incorrectly classified as EXPORT_ARBITRAGE

## [5.1.5] - 2026-01-17

### Fixed

- Fixed floating-point precision issue in DP algorithm where near-zero power levels (e.g., 2.2e-16) were incorrectly classified as charging/discharging instead of IDLE
- Fixed edge case in optimization where no valid action at boundary states (e.g., max SOE with unprofitable discharge) would leave period data undefined, now creates proper IDLE state
- Fixed `grid_to_battery` energy flow calculation to be correctly constrained by actual battery charging amount, preventing impossible energy flows

## [2.5.7] - 2025-11-10

### Fixed

### Changed

- Settings classes now convert camelCase API keys to snake_case attributes automatically
- Removed silent hasattr() checks in favor of explicit error handling
